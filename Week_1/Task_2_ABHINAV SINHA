NEOCOGNITRON
•	A neural network model for recognizing visual patterns, it is self-organized and is not affected by the position of the stimulus. Tries to mimic how our brain perceives visual information, and has a hierarchical structure similar to it.
•	It consists of a cascade connection of modular structures preceded by an input layer. Each of the modular structure has 2 layers of cells. First layer is the S layer. They are responsible for detecting small features. They have plasticity. The next layer is C cells. Each C cell is connected with a small region of S cells and if any one of the S cell is activated then the C cell gets activated. In this way the C cell accommodates for positional invariance in the network.
•	In this manner there are multiple layers of S and C cells, and as we go deeper the receptive field increases, the density of cells decreases, and little by little the network accommodates more and more noisy inputs(distorted or translated). 
•	All the cells in a cell plane have input synapses of the same spatial distribution, and only the positions of presynaptic cells are shifted in parallel from cell to cell. This allows the network to look for a specific feature in the entirety of the image.
•	For self organization, at first several representative cells are selected. The S cells which have yielded a large output are selected, but there should not be more than one representative from a single S layer. The input synapses to a representative S cell are reinforced, infact all the S cells in that cell’s S layer have their input synapses reinforced. 
•	An S column contains S cells from all S planes. An S column contains all kinds of feature extracting cells, but their receptive fields are almost the same. From each S column whenever an S cell yields a high output, it is considered as a candidate for being representative, usually the cells with largest output is selected. Also there is only 1 representative from each S layer.  Because of this, each S layer becomes sensitive to a particular feature.
•	In neocognitron, the comparison is not made by a wide pattern matching, but a piecewise pattern in small visual fields. Such comparison is not performed in a single stage, but it is applied in a cascade. Output from one stage is used as input for next stage.In each stage the allowance for shift in pattern’s position is increased little by little. Size of visual field also increases in each stage and in the final stage, visual field is large enough to observe the whole information of the input pattern simultaneously.
