Summary of neural network-

A Neural network is a machine learning model that predicts something just 
like our brain does by using its well-connected network of neurons to identify
phenomena and predict the output according to that.

Neural network consists of several layers. The first layer is called the input layer and
the last layer is called the output layer in between those all layers are called hidden layers. 
Each neuron has its activation value by which it causes fire to some specific neurons of the next
layer and so on by this method neural network trains itself over time and with great accuracy, 
a model is ready to predict a good output.

Neural network is just like a function in which we put input and expect output corresponding to that.

Linear regression :- It is a method to predict a suitable value of slope and intercept 
for best fit line so that it predicts the right output for that one operation. 
Activation function is a function that calculates the output of the node based on its
inputs and their weights. Generally, we use the sigmoid function (output is between 0 to 1).
Working- 

Each node in the input layer has its own activation energy. In order to connect each node to the next layer,
we use linear regression to determine the appropriate weight and bias.Specifically, each node 
in the previous layer is connected to all the nodes in the next layer.

To prepare our input for the activation function, we need to multiply the activation values of 
the initial layer by their respective weights and then add the bias. 
This is similar to multiplying a weight matrix with an activation column vector and then 
adding a bias column vector.

After applying the sigmoid function, we obtain the activation value for the nodes in the next layer. 
This process is repeated for layer 1 and so on until the final output is reached.





Summary of Convolution Nueral Network-

Convolutional neural networks use three-dimensional data for image classification and 
object recognition tasks.Convolution between two functions in mathematics produces a third
function expressing how the shape of one function is modified by other.

Convolution is a mathematical technique that involves multiplying two arrays 
of numbers. The second array is flipped and then the first and second arrays 
are multiplied together, element by element, starting from the first element of
the second array. The products of all possible pairs of elements from both arrays 
are added up to generate the final result. Now we have the new array of output.

Convolution is majorly used in image processing and voice recognition 
In Image processing, we have a filters and input image so in the input image
we apply filter that performs multiplication between filter matrix to input matrix 
and the method convolution so then we got output matrix.

Polynomial multiplication:- To perform polynomial multiplication, we can use convolution. We 
can set the components of the first equation in columns and the second equation in rows.Then,
we multiply the corresponding terms and add up the values along every diagonal. 
This will give us the result of the multiplication of the two polynomials.

When dealing with long polynomials, performing calculations can be time-consuming due to its 
high time complexity. To overcome this issue, we can use a method called FFT. This involves 
using roots of unity instead of constant coefficients.
