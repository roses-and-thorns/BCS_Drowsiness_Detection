### NEOCOGNITRON , FUKUSHIMA(1980)

The research paper gives us the information on the evolution of the neural network “neocognitron” and its working for visual pattern recognition.

-Neocognitron recognizes patterns by observing geometrical patterns of the input and does not get changed by any distortion in the shape.
-It was the first architecture in the world of CNNs.
-It relies on the concept of feature extraction, pooling layers, and using convolution in a neural network.
-The whole network, comprised of layers containing two types of cells namely the S-cells(Simple Cells) and the C-cells(Complex cells) each present alternatively the network system.
-The process of feature-extraction by S-cells and toleration of positional shift by C-cells was repeated.
-It has the potential to self learn things without human interference.
-It is made upon the hierarchal model given by Hubel and Wiesel [LGB(lateral geniculate body) simple cellscomplex cellslower order hypercomplex cells higher order hyper complex cells].

##STRUCTURE

-The structure of the network was inspired by that of the visual nervous system of vertebrates.

-Basically, the model broadly consists of two layers containign of S-cells(lower order hypercomplex cells) and C-cells(higher order hypercomplex cells) present alternatively in the network.
-Only the input corrsponding to the S-cells can be modified.
-Within the respective layers of the two type of cells, they are divided into subgroups based on their receptive features.
-In the context of the neocognitron, a cell plane refers to a group of cells that are arranged retinotopically and share the same set of input connections.They are arranged in a 2-D array.
-In the network layer, as the layer deepens the cell density decreases accordingly.
- A C-cell layer has synaptic connections with a group of S-cells in its adjacent S plane.

##Self-organization of the Network

This is basically learning and adapting to new features and information without human interference or more precisely learning on our own.

-It is based on the model of of repeatingly giving some patterns without any other information.
-In the whole network, with its alternate layers of S-cells (simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells) and C-cells (complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells), the process of feature-extraction by S-cells and toleration of positional shift by C-cells was repeated.

-In an input layer of S-cell, where the receptive fields are arranged close to each other we focus on group of S-cells.
-the s-cell having the highest representation is selected from an s column.
-the one having the highest representation is selected, if only a single candidated is their, it is automatically selected and become the representative but if their are no candidates then their is no representation from that plane.



##  Rough Sketches of the Working of the Network 

-Basically, it tells us that each layer identifies certain information about the input image when the the cell representing that feature in a plane gives a significant output.
The other layers do the same with other features and hence by combining all these we finally get our output


## Computer Simulation


-The computer simulation is a seven layered network that contains equal number of S-cells for every cell layer, although the size observed in a layer increases when there is a decrease in density of cells in a cell plane.

-The given image shows how it self recognizes the provided patterns .
All the images in the figure have given the same result which shows that the neocognitron has correctly recognized the patterns irrespective of the distortions in shape or sizes or any shift in position.

-The given figure shows the individual response of each cell.


##Conclusion

The "neocognitron" proposed in this paper has an ability to recognize stimulus patterns without affected by shift in position nor by a small distortion in shape of the stimulus patterns.
 If a set of stimulus patterns are repeatedly presented to it, it gradually acquires the ability to recognize these patterns. It is not necessary to give any instructions about the categories to which the stimulus patterns should belong.
